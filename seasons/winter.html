        <p>The winter time is by far the slowest time of the year for me. I really enjoy skiing and snowshoeing. You can catch me at great divide on the weekends skiing with my buddies. I also enjoy sledding with friends and family during the holiday season. During the winter months people like to spend their time either traveling or getting ready for the holiday season.  </p>
