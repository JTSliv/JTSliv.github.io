        <p>The spring is probably my least favorite time of the year because of how bipolar the weather is. However I try to spend as much as time outside when the weather is good. Typically I am golfing or hanging out with buddies during the spring. Spring time is also a busy time to be traveling on vacations. Some of my favorite spring trips involve going on cruises or going to Cancun Mexico.</p>
