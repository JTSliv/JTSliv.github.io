        <h1>Favorite State Website</h1 <h1><a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov"</a><h1>
    <p> The number one website in my opinion was the State of Arkansas. For starters the eye color was very pleasing and it made for a very clean look. The website loaded quickly making it an efficient website for users. They offered a lot of information about the state of Arkansas such as government officials, jobs, travel recommendations in a very organized manner. Because of this you are able to find information very easily. The website is also very accessbile on your mobile phone or computer. Overall they did a very solid job of creating a website that is very easy for people to use.</p>
    
            <h2>Second Favorite State Website </h2> <h2><a href="https://www.maine.gov"</a></h2>
    
    <p> My second favorite website had to be the state of Maine. They were very close to be numbering one over Arkansas. What I liked about them is how they kept it a very simple yet organized website. You could find information easily throughout the website. The feature that I liked the best was having a search bar in the middle of the page. I feel like that was the best way to access information quickly. Maine did a great job with their website design making it easy for people to access information.</p>
    
            <h3> Third Favorite Website</h3> <h3><a href="https://portal.kansas.gov"</a></h3>
            <p>Kansas was my third favorite for a few reasons. I think the overall color and layout of the page is very basic and boring. However on the flipside it is very practical and makes finding information very easy. The website loaded rather quickly. Overall a very solid website for the state of Kansas, just wasn't very detailed like Arkansas and Maine.</p>
    
            <h4> Fourth Favorite Website</h4> <h4><a href="https://alaska.gov"</a></h4>
    <p> Alaska was my fourth favorite website. There's nothing really bad about this page, however it is super bland and nothing really stands out. They have a lot of information however it is not super accessible and requires a lot of searching. I think they could do a lot better at making this website more organized.</p>
        
            <h5> Least Favorite State Website</h5> <h5><a href="https://www.maryland.gov"</a></h5>
    <p> By far my least favorite page was the state of Maryland. It was very boring, I would expect a state government to do a much better job. When I look at a website, I prefer it to be easy to navigate and well put together. I feel like this website had a lot of random information throughout the page. The color coordination did not make much sense, just seemed like a very rushed process. However they did have lot's of information and users could find what they were looking for fairly easily. This website could definetly use a lot of improvement. </p>
