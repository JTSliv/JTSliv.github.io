        <p>The fall is most definetly my second favorite time of the year. First off I enjoy fall golf for so many reasons. The course is typically in great shape, however because of the weather many people choose not to play. Which means the course is wide open and not very busy. Fall also means Football season, so after I am done playing golf on the weekends I can enjoy both college and professional football. Others like to spend their time carving pumpkins as halloween rolls around!</p>
