        <p>The summers are jam packed for me. You can most definetly catch me outdoors playing golf, fishing, working, or cooking delicous food for friends and family. My favorite food to cook would be hamburger sliders on hawaiian rolls. Other people like to enjoy their summers by going boating, taking family trips to national parks around the country, or family reunions. </p>
