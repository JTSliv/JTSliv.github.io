    <h1><a href="https://espn.com">ESPN</a></h1>
    <p>The first website that I will be higlighting that I think is great would be the ESPN website. What I like about this website is how organized they keep it with the vast amounts of information they store. For example if I want to find college football games for the upcoming week I simply click on the college football tab and select schedule. Furthermore they provide information on the location of the game, what television channel it is on, and what each team is ranked. These are just a few of the vast amounts of information that they offer. The website is very modern with clean colors that complement each other well. The layout is well put together, you can find information by going through different tabs for each sport they cover.When it comes to navigating the website I believe it is easy to navigate if you have scrolled through it before. For someone brand new to the website I doubt they would be able to find information quickly. Espn mainly uses only two colors, white and red. Whether it's game schedule's, stats, injury reports, player profiles. You can access so much sports information that set's them apart from other sports websites. Overall ESPN does a very good job when it comes to navigation, information, and color coding.</p>
    
    <h2><a href="https://www.callawaygolf.com">Callaway Golf</a></h2>
    <p>The second website that I will be covering is the Callaway golf brand website. I have been a loyal user of Callaway golf clubs over the years because of their performance and when it comes to their website I am just as impressed. I like this website because of it's simplicity and easy information to access. The code is very modern which translates to a modern looking website. The layout is great and makes perfect sense. You can select on a number of tabs to select the golf clubs, balls, and accessories that you need. This makes it super easy and quick to navigate. They use very simple colors of white and black, nothing special. However they complement each other well and let the information do the talking. When it comes to little details that sets themselves apart, they are very good at including additional information in little spaces. For example warranties, counterfeit warnings, and return policys are very important when it comes to golf clubs and Callaway does a great job of including that information in the bottom section of the home page. They make it easy to access and more importantly they give you the correct information on who to contact. They also go super in depth into educating the consumer on what product is best for their golf game. Callaway golf does a great job of educating the consumer on their products by having an easy website to navigate with a great amount of information that is not overwhelming. </p>
    
    <h3><a href="https://owl.purdue.edu">Purdue Owl College of Liberal Arts</a></h3>
    <p> My absolute least favorite website is Purdue Owl. While it has been very helpful to me in the past in terms of it's information. The reason why I dislike it so much is because it is not a very organized website. Everytime I use it, it takes forever to find the exact resource I need. They have so many different tabs and when you click on one, it takes you to even more tabs. If the website would take you to more direct places, it would be much easier to navigate. The code is modern for the most part, however it could use some updating. The layout doesn't make much sense to me. The search bar and tabs are not in any real logical order. Navigating through the website is just straight confusing. When it comes to color coding they use black, white, brown, and grey. The colors go well together and overall I have no complaints when it comes to the overall color of the website. What seperates this website apart from others is how extensive they are when it comes to writing. They go very in depth into the proper formatting between MLA, Chicago, APA, and other styles, which is something you can't really find any where else.</p>
